  # burn CD with code, JAR, readme, powerpoint for dr wang 
  # send dr spickler email with instructions

  # HELP SYSTEM (html) -- write and edit more 
  # visualize XOR (non animated?)
  # alert box on bad inputs so user knows what is wrong
  # more labels and/or hover text
  # improve copy+paste stuff
