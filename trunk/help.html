<p>CryptoViz is a visualization and learning tool for Cryptography algorithms. 
Cryptoviz uses DES (Data Encryption Standard) to demonstrate how cipher algorithms function.</p>

<h2>Quick DES<a name="quickdes"></a></h2>

<p>Quick DES is a simple encryption utility built into CryptoViz. This allows the user to test encryptions in other areas of the program.
<br>
<br>
Enter any amount of text into the first text area, in either ASCII or hex.
<br>
<br>
Alternatively, browse for a text file that you would like to encrypt.
<br>
<br>
Enter your preferred key. This should be 8 hexadecimal characters.
<br>
<br>
Press the Encrypt button to encrypt the data. The first block of input plain text is converted to cypher text and shown in the output box.
</p>
<br />
<h2>Key Visualization<a name="key"></a></h2>

<p>The Key Visualization page shows the Data Encryption Standard algorithm for producting 16 subkeys from one key.
<br><br>
Enter an 8 character key in plain ASCII text. (If key is longer than 8 characters, it will be truncated.)
<br><br>
Press the "To Binary" button.  CryptoViz converts your ASCII text into it's binary equivalent, and displays this in the appropriate text box.
<br><br>
Also, a graphic representation of the binary key appears at the top of the page.
<br><br>
The following buttons are functions used by DES to permute the key and generate subkeys.
<br><br>
The user can click on each of these buttons to see how the bits in the binary key are permuted.
<br><br>
The PC2 buttons generate each of the 16 subkeys.
<br><br>
The slider allows the user to make the visualization faster or slower.
<br><br>
The Do All button performs each function in order and displays all 16 subkeys.
</p>

<h2>DES Visualization<a name="des"></a></h2>

<p>
The DES Visualization page shows the entire process of encrypting one block of data using the DES encryption algorithm.
<br><br>
The Fiestel Structure is displayed, with blank areas for each data area.
<br><br>
In the Plain Text block, enter 64 bits of data, in either ASCII or Hex.
<br><br>
In the Key block, enter 64 bits of data, in either ASCII or Hex.
<br><br>
Next, click Generate Keys to generate all of the 16 subkeys. This process is not visualized in this window, but can be seen in the "Key Visualization" window.
<br><br>
Next, click the Encrypt button. This fills out the entire Fiestel structure. 
<br><br>
All data is converted to hexadecimal.
<br><br>
The user can also Visualize each round of the Fiestel structure, by click the Visualize Round # button.
<br><br>
This brings up a new window that shows the round in more detail.
<br><br>
This shows the incoming binary string at the top of the window. It is then split in to Left and Right halves.
<br><br>
The E button expands the right half of input. This is visualized at the bottom of the window.
<br><br>
The X button exclusively ORs this with the right half of input.
<br><br>
The S button is for S Box permutation.
<br><br>
The P button is for the next permutation.
<br><br>
Finally, this is exclusively ORed with the left half of input. The result of this becomes the final right half of output. The left half of output is the original right half. This is shown by the lines connecting the text boxes.
